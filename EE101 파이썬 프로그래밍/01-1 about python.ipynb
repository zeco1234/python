    "## Features of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Simple**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a simple and minimalistic language. Reading a good Python program feels almost like reading English, although very strict English! This pseudo-code nature of Python is one of its greatest strengths. It allows you to concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than the language itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Easy to Learn**\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see, Python is extremely easy to get started with. Python has an extraordinarily simple syntax, as already mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Free and Open Source**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an example of a _FLOSS_ (Free/Libre and Open Source Software). In simple terms, you can freely distribute copies of this software, read its source code, make changes to it, and use pieces of it in new free programs. FLOSS is based on the concept of a community which shares knowledge. This is one of the reasons why Python is so good - it has been created and is constantly improved by a community who just want to see a better Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **High-level Language**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write programs in Python, you never need to bother about the low-level details such as managing the memory used by your program, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Portable**\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its open-source nature, Python has been ported to (i.e. changed to make it work on) many platforms. All your Python programs can work on any of these platforms without requiring any changes at all if you are careful enough to avoid any system-dependent features.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Python on GNU/Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, Macintosh, Solaris, OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400, BeOS, OS/390, z/OS, Palm OS, QNX, VMS, Psion, Acorn RISC OS, VxWorks, PlayStation, Sharp Zaurus, Windows CE and PocketPC!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even use a platform like [Kivy](http://kivy.org) to create games for your computer _and_ for iPhone, iPad, and Android.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Interpreted**\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires a bit of explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A program written in a compiled language like C or C\\++ is converted from the source language i.e. C or C++ into a language that is spoken by your computer (binary code i.e. 0s and 1s) using a compiler with various flags and options. When you run the program, the linker/loader software copies the program from hard disk to memory and starts running it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, on the other hand, does not need compilation to binary. You just _run_ the program directly from the source code. Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes and then translates this into the native language of your computer and then runs it. All this, actually, makes using Python much easier since you don't have to worry about compiling the program, making sure that the proper libraries are linked and loaded, etc. This also makes your Python programs much more portable, since you can just copy your Python program onto another computer and it just works!\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Object Oriented**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports procedure-oriented programming as well as object-oriented programming (OOP). In _procedure-oriented_ languages, the program is built around procedures or functions which are nothing but reusable pieces of programs. In _object-oriented_ languages, the program is built around objects which combine data and functionality. Python has a very powerful but simplistic way of doing OOP, especially when compared to big languages like C++ or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Extensible**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a critical piece of code to run very fast or want to have some piece of algorithm not to be open, you can code that part of your program in C or C\\++ and then use it from your Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Embeddable**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can embed Python within your C/C\\++ programs to give _scripting_ capabilities for your program's users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Extensive Libraries**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Standard Library is huge indeed. It can help you do various things involving regular expressions,documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, FTP, email, XML, XML-RPC, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI (graphical user interfaces), and other system-dependent stuff. Remember, all this is always available wherever Python is installed. This is called the _Batteries Included_ philosophy of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries which you can find at the [Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is indeed an exciting and powerful language. It has the right combination of performance and features that make writing programs in Python both fun and easy.\n"

    "## What Programmers Say\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find it interesting to read what great hackers like Eric S. Raymond (ESR) have to say about Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Eric S. Raymond_ is the author of \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\" and is also the person who coined the term _Open Source_. He says that [Python has become his favorite programming language](http://www.python.org/about/success/esr/). This article was the real inspiration for my first brush with Python.\n",
    "- _Bruce Eckel_ is the author of the famous 'Thinking in Java' and 'Thinking in C++' books. He says that no language has made him more productive than Python. He says that Python is perhaps the only language that focuses on making things easier for the programmer. Read the [complete interview](http://www.artima.com/intv/aboutme.html) for more details.\n",
    "- _Peter Norvig_ is a well-known Lisp author and Director of Search Quality at Google (thanks to Guido van Rossum for pointing that out). He says that [writing Python is like writing in pseudocode](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1803815). He says that Python has always been an integral part of Google. You can actually verify this statement by looking at the [Google Jobs](http://www.google.com/jobs/index.html) page which lists Python knowledge as a requirement for software engineers.\n"

    "> I wrote you back in 2011 and I was just getting into Python and wanted to thank you for your tutorial \"A Byte of Python\".  Without it, I would have fallen by the wayside.  Since then I have gone on to program a number of functions in my organization with this language with yet more on the horizon.  I would not call myself an advanced programmer by any stretch but I notice the occasional request for assistance now from others since I started using it.  I discovered, while reading \"Byte\" why I had ceased studying C and C\\++ and it was because the book given to me started out with an example containing an augmented assignment.  Of course, there was no explanation for this arrangement of operators and I fell on my head trying to make sense of what was on the written page.  As I recall it was a most frustrating exercise which I eventually abandoned. Doesn't mean C or C++ is impossible to learn, or even that I am stupid, but it does mean that the documentation I worked my way through did not define the symbols and words which is an essential part of any instruction. Just as computers will not be able to understand a computer word or computer symbol that is outside the syntax for the language being used, a student new to any field will not grasp his subject if he encounters words or symbols for which there are no definitions.  You get a \"blue screen\" as it were in either case.  The solution is simple, though: find the word or symbol and get the proper definition or symbol and lo and behold,the computer or student can proceed.  Your book was so well put together that I found very little in it I couldn't grasp.  So, thank you.  I encourage you to continue to include full definitions of terms.  The documentation with Python is good, once you know, (the examples are its strength from what I see) but in many cases it seems that you have to know in order to understand the documentation which to my mind is not what should be.  Third party tutorials express the need for clarification of the documentation and their success largely depends on the words that are used to describe the terminology.  I have recommended your book to many others. Some in Australia, some in the Caribbean and yet others in the US. It fills a niche no others do.

    "# Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is probably one of the few programming languages which is both simple and powerful. This is good for beginners as well as for experts, and more importantly, is fun to program with. This book aims to help you learn this wonderful language and show how to get things done quickly and painlessly - in effect 'The Anti-venom to your programming problems'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who This Book Is For\n",
    "\n",
    "This book serves as a guide or tutorial to the Python programming language. It is mainly targeted at newbies. It is useful for experienced programmers as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is that if all you know about computers is how to save text files, then you can learn Python from this book. If you have previous programming experience, then you can also learn Python from this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do have previous programming experience, you will be interested in the differences between Python and your favorite programming language - I have highlighted many such differences. A little warning though, Python is soon going to become your favorite programming language!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Official Website\n",
    "\n",
    "The official website of the book is {{ book.officialUrl }} where you can read the whole book online, download the latest versions of the book, [buy a printed hard copy]({{ book.buyBookUrl }}) and also send me feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Something To Think About\n",
